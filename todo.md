- [x] Make a CLI audio analyzer
- [x] Hide the modes BPSK63, QPSK31, QPSK63 from the list. They're not ready.
- [x] Updating the baud rate or squelch in settings for rtty doesn't seem to update either. I have to restart the app. Why don't those settings update immediately?
- [x] In the RTTY channel list and message transcript, the title should be the actual baud rate for RTTY, not a static 45.5

## Channel List
- [x] Show the full live decode tail, not head in the channel list.
- [x] Show up to the most recently decoded 2 lines in real-time.

## Message Transcript
